Satisfactory Calculator
======================
This is a simple calculator for Satisfactory. It is a work in progress, and I will be adding more features as I go along. I am also open to suggestions for features to add.

# Requirements
You will need to have [Java](https://www.java.com/es/download/) installed in your computer or a interpreter like [IntelliJ](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/).

# How to use it
Download the jar from [Releases](https://github.com/UnzorZ/SatisfactoryCrafter/releases) and open it just double-clicking it.
You will see a window with some buttons and text fields. The first text fields are for specifying the program how many nodes you have, the second one is the amount of items you want to  craft per minute.
The last button is for asking the program to do the math and show you the results.

# How to contribute (Windows/Linux)

First, you will need to clone the repository, to do that open `cmd`/`terminal` and type `git clone https://github.com/UnzorZ/SatisfactoryCrafter.git`.
That will clone the repository in the folder you were at the moment. Keep in mind that you will need to have [git](https://git-scm.com/) installed in your pc.

Then open the folder with your preferred IDE, in my case, I use Intellij. Then make the changes you want and build it typing in the IDE terminal `./gradlew build`. Try it and if it works,
and you want your changes in the project, open a **Pull Request** and i will check it out.
