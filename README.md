<p id="description">This is a simple calculator for Satisfactory. It is a work in progress and I will be adding more features as I go along. I am also open to suggestions for features to add.</p>


<h2>üõ†Ô∏è Requirements </h2>
The only requirement is having [Java](https://www.java.com/es/download/) installed in your computer or a interpreter like [IntelliJ](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea).

<h2>üßê Features</h2>

Here're some of the project's best features:

*   Easy to use
*   Clean code
*   Great documentation
*   Auto-updates ingame recipes
*   Add edit or remove recipes
*   Manage quality of manufacturers constructors etc
*   Easy to manage materials

<h2>üç∞ How to contribute (Windows/Linux) </h2>

First, you will need to clone the repository, to do that open `cmd`/`terminal` and type `git clone https://github.com/UnzorZ/CustomRPC-WIP.git`.
That will clone the repository in the folder you were at the moment. Keep in mind that you will need to have [git](https://git-scm.com/) installed in your pc.

Then open the folder with your preferred IDE, in my case, I use Intellij. Then make the changes you want and build it typing in the IDE terminal `./gradlew build`. Try it and if it works,
and you want your changes in the project, open a **Pull Request** and i will check it out.
